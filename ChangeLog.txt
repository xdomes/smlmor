ChangeLog

2009-10-15  0.0.2pre2
	- statusLabel included 
	
2009-10-14  0.0.2pre1
	- interface improved with tabpanels.
	- SOostethys2Doc: reflection used to assign values to beans; tree dump also generated
	  for testing and comparison purposes: in particular, the generated SensorML seems
	  to be missing some settings to properly specify systems and variables
	
2009-10-12  0.0.1
	- Initial scheme to create interface and generate SML.
	- The following "schema" is processed:
		oostethys =
			Web service URL
			serviceContact
			system+
		system =
			metadata 
			OutputOrComponents
		metadata =
			systemContact
			systemMetadata
		OutputOrComponents = 
			Output | system+
		Output = 
			variable+

	- multiplicity of variables and multiplicity and nesting of systems and are handled.
	  
	- NOTE: oostethys2describeSensor.xsl focuses on a part of the elements for a DescribeSensor response.
	        TODO: complement.
	        			
	
2009-10-08  0.0.1pre2
	- now includes basic generation of SML using oostethys-xmlbeans-0.3.9.jar
	- MainPanel: the fields here are just dummy; click generate to generated a
	  fixed SensorML.
	  
	Tried to enable maven for this project but no much success, so for now continuing
	a la Ant ;)
	
2009-09-25  0.0.1pre
	Preliminary set-up of this project
