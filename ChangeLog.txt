ChangeLog

2010-07-23  0.0.2pre6
	- SparqlUtil.runQuery: now requests "csv" output format (instead of "json") because of 
	  current limitation in the Ont service (see iserver and ont modules).
	  
	  The behavior was that the selection of URIs (eg when clicking one of the "choose"
	  buttons) was not returning because of an unnoticed exception because of the
	  parsing error (assumed to be "json" but actually being returned in "csv").
	  
	- FieldWithChoose: using DISTINCT in query.
	
	  
2009-12-06  0.0.2pre5
	- Newer version of CF does not define/use the class Parameter. Now using
	  http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter/Standard_Name
	  
2009-11-18  0.0.2pre4
	- FieldWithChoose: make sure no item is selected so we get an change event on the 
	  first item (needed for firefox at least).
	
2009-11-02  0.0.2pre3
	- Dispatching some drop-down lists for selection of URIs, which are populated
	  via SPARQL queries to obtain the instances of corresponding given classes.

2009-10-15  0.0.2pre2
	- statusLabel included 
	- etc/*.xml with files sent by Joaquin del Rio
	
2009-10-14  0.0.2pre1
	- interface improved with tabpanels.
	- SOostethys2Doc: reflection used to assign values to beans; tree dump also generated
	  for testing and comparison purposes: in particular, the generated SensorML seems
	  to be missing some settings to properly specify systems and variables
	
2009-10-12  0.0.1
	- Initial scheme to create interface and generate SML.
	- The following "schema" is processed:
		oostethys =
			Web service URL
			serviceContact
			system+
		system =
			metadata 
			OutputOrComponents
		metadata =
			systemContact
			systemMetadata
		OutputOrComponents = 
			Output | system+
		Output = 
			variable+

	- multiplicity of variables and multiplicity and nesting of systems and are handled.
	  
	- NOTE: oostethys2describeSensor.xsl focuses on a part of the elements for a DescribeSensor response.
	        TODO: complement.
	        			
	
2009-10-08  0.0.1pre2
	- now includes basic generation of SML using oostethys-xmlbeans-0.3.9.jar
	- MainPanel: the fields here are just dummy; click generate to generated a
	  fixed SensorML.
	  
	Tried to enable maven for this project but no much success, so for now continuing
	a la Ant ;)
	
2009-09-25  0.0.1pre
	Preliminary set-up of this project
